Mugen 1.1b1 version of the same Mugen 1.0 mods.

If you're unaware of what that means, it makes it so that you can select
three or four players in simultaneous mode.  This really only works in
watch mode after pushing ctrl+1 to enable your player.  If you try this
in other modes, all of your teammates will be controlled as if they're
player 1.  That's not very fun.


生存模式用这个

4v4 ai357.exe

AI Enable mods
This allows you to play 3v3 and 4v4 in arcade and survival mode.

ctrl+2 = Enable Player 3
ctrl+3 = Enable Player 5
ctrl+4 = Enable Player 7
This is required as Mugen 1.1b1 no longer supports custom keybinds.
